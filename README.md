- 👋 Hi, I’m @blackloa
- 👀 I’m interested in Physics, Comp Sci, Biomed and biotech in general, more specifically neuroscience and prosthetics, combining natural and synthetic sciences.
- 🌱 I’m currently refreshing my programming knowledge, just going over the very basics for now.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple super basic easy projects? I'm good at boring and tedious work and I'm a fast learner at anything new, 
      provided it isnt like ridiculously out of my skill set, for now im only comfortable working with C++, C, Java, Javascript, and HTML, though I'm learning Python right now.
- 📫 How to reach me you can reach me at alexanderrrees@gmail.com
